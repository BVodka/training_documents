## Area of focus 
###Data Science general knowledge 
- Basic statistics and data visualization
- Normalization ( data preparation )
- Evaluation metrics , what each metrics signal 
- Cross validation
- Hyper parameter tuning (hyperdrive)
- Different sampling method ( parameter for hyperdrive
- Feature selections ( which method for which case )
- Requires business understanding of 3 mains algorithms , anomaly detection, recommendation, utilize different data sources depends on business use case 
### Azure services 
- Apply business scenarios
- Focus on Azure SDK - a large content of the exam will be testing on this
- ML Designer pipelines ( training and ingest pipeline ) - a few 
- AutoML : automl for forecasting , decision making  ml designer in azure ML workspace - very important 
- Train model using estimator -e.g Pytorch ( estimator )
- *Code* get resources in Azure infrastructure here
- *Code* Loading dataset , deploy models and pipeline, consume pipeline, method of deployment from a script here, method of predicting
- Focus on lesson #6 Udacity Azure 
- (AKS, SDK- enviroments, benefits ) : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/use-automated-machine-learning/deploy-model
- Metadata - importing share explainner- a few
